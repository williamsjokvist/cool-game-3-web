It was a night full of simplistic songs with simplistic lyrics, but it was fun enough to clap and sing along to. At the end of the day, David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff was not as bad as I suspected when my friend initially harassed me to attend the gig with her. After all, there were some fine moments like the epic \"True Survivor\",  some well-sung semi-decent ballads, and  lots of fun and giggles. With this experience behind me, I can call myself a true survivor too!
